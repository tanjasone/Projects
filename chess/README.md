I started this project after my first class learning Java. I wanted to try figuring out how to use the GUI libraries, Java AWT and Java Swing(granted, I have heard that they're not particularly worthing learning in-depth given that there are tools that simplify their usage such as NetBeans and Eclipse GUI Builders).
