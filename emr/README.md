Electronic Medical Records
--------------------------
This was a project commissioned by my dad who works as a medical doctor. He just needed a system could be used to enter patient demographical information such as name, date of birth, race, sex, etc as well as some associated insurance information, and retrieve stored patient information, displaying it in a sorted list, where it can then be updated if need be. I was able to employ my Java Swing experience gained from working on my chess application to create a GUI for this as well.
